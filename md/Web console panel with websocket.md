##### [Simulate console in web/html page with websocket server.](https://github.com/suntabu/WebsocketConsoleTool.git)

Idea from [AndroidConsoleServer (I call it ACS)](https://github.com/suntabu/AndroidConsoleServer), but ACS uses jquery for looply fetch server data, not convenient for server commands developing. With websocket, server could send information to web page by itself.
